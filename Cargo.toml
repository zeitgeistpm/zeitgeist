[patch."https://github.com/purestake/crowdloan-rewards"]
# This patch does ensure that crowdloan-rewards only uses partiytech dependencies.
# If it is not used, the Zeitgeist runtimes will contain duplicate crates from
# different repositories which results in bigger WASM-blobs, binary and the inability
# to compile with the "runtime-benchmarks" feature.
