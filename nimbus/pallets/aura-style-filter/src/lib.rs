//! A Nimbus filter for the AuRa consensus algorithm. This filter does not use any entropy, it
//! simply rotates authors in order. A single author is eligible at each slot.
//!
//! In the Substrate ecosystem, this algorithm is typically known as AuRa (authority round).
//! There is a well known implementation in the main Substrate repository and published at
//! https://crates.io/crates/sc-consensus-aura. There are two primary differences between
//! the approaches:
//!
//! 1. This filter leverages all the heavy lifting of the Nimbus framework and consequently is
//!    capable of expressing Aura in < 100 lines of code.
//!
//!    Whereas sc-consensus-aura includes the entire consensus stack including block signing, digest
//!    formats, and slot prediction. This is a lot of overhead for a sipmle round robin
//!    consensus that basically boils down to this function
//!    https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/0f849efc/client/consensus/aura/src/lib.rs#L91-L106
//!
//! 2. The Nimbus framework places the author checking logic in the runtime which makes it relatively
//!    easy for relay chain validators to confirm the author is valid.
//!
//!    Whereas sc-consensus-aura places the author checking offchain. The offchain approach is fine
//!    for standalone layer 1 blockchains, but net well suited for verification on the relay chain
//!    where validators only run a wasm blob.
