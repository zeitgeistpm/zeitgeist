//! Small pallet responsible determining which accounts are eligible to author at the current
//! slot.
//!
//! Using a randomness beacon supplied by the `Randomness` trait, this pallet takes the set of
//! currently active accounts from an upstream source, and filters them down to a pseudorandom subset.
//! The current technique gives no preference to any particular author. In the future, we could
//! disfavor authors who are authoring a disproportionate amount of the time in an attempt to
//! "even the playing field".
